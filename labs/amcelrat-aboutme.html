        <h1>McElrath, Amber</h1>
        <p>My name is Amber McElrath and I am a junior studying broadcast and digital journalism with a minor in the ISchool. After I graduate, I want to do digital and social media for a professional sports team. I think my communications skills and the skills I am learning in the ISchool will allow me to be succesful in the future.</p>
        <p>I am from Horsham, PA and I have two brothers. My favorite movie series is Star Wars and I am currently watching the TV show Star Wars Rebels. I love to go hiking and skiing with my friends and family. My favorite food is mashed potatoes but pasta is a close second.</p>
